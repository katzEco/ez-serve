# ez-serve

## A kind of express.js port listening wrapper

I'm just toooooo lazy to rewrite this code every time I'm trying to start new express.js project so I just make this :)

## Usage

Just install this package into your express project and call

```ts
import ezServe from 'ez-serve'
...
ezServe(<express app constant>, <port you want to serve>)
```
